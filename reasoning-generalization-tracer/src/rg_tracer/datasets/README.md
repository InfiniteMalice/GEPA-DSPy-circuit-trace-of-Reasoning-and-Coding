# RG-Tracer Datasets

This directory contains lightweight JSONL datasets for quick experiments.
Each JSON line encodes a problem with fields such as `id`, `prompt`,
`numbers`, `answer`, and optional `metrics` for pre-computed axis inputs.

* `toy_math/` — simple arithmetic and algebra problems.
* `transfer_tests/` — held-out generalisation problems grouped by concept.
